# Art Therapy Project

*In collaboration with the Neuroplasticity Lab @ City College of New York.*

Analysis of data collected from patients affected by Parkinson's disease who followed **Art Therapy**.

**Art Therapy** is a novel and promising methodology to slow down the development of Parkinson's disease. Patients who undergo this therapy are involved in artistic activities, such as painting, carving, and drawing.   

The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of **Art Therapy** and how it can potentially relate to different conditions of the patients (e.g., sex, age, stage of the disease, ...). The data under analysis are the outcomes of different tests used to assess the *cognitive, motor, and visuospatial abilities* of approximately 50 patients, measured at baseline and at follow-up. 

In the Jupyter notebooks reported in this repository the following tasks are performed:
- Dataset preparation
- Missing data imputation
- Feature importance analysis in order to identify the most significant features at baseline that may influence the success of the treatment
- Classification of subjects based on their BL features (still in progress as we expect to collect new data...)

The project is still in progress, as researchers expect to obtain new data from new subjects.
